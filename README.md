## Keywords:

### Quality definition

Small q(functional quality): Software functional quality reflects how well it complies with or __conforms__ to a given design
* Measurements are taken regularly to determine conformance to those requirements. The non-conformances are regarded as defects
* Measured by
  * defect rate 
    * number of defects per million lines of source code
    * per function point, or other unit
  * reliability 
    * number of failures per n hours of operation
    * mean time to failure
    * the probability of failure free operation in a specified time
    
Big Q(structural quality): Fitness for use (relative to needs)
* takes customers' requirements and expectations into account
  * Customer satisfaction: percent satisfied
*  Includes other attributes
  * product quality
  * process quality
  * customer satisfaction
  * project business objectives
  * organizational objectives

Process quality vs. Product Quality 

**Quality metrics and models are our focus**

**“Optimize” quality (not maximize)**

**Processes:**

### Quality engineering

* Quality engineering is about effective ways to achieve project objectives. 
* Processes and metrics are enablers to achieve these objectives. 
* Metrics Interpretation is the real value added by the quality engineer.
